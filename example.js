/**
 * This script sets up an incoming payment on a receiving wallet address,

 *
 * The final step is asking for an outgoing payment grant for the sending wallet address.
 * Since this needs user interaction, you will need to navigate to the URL, and accept the interactive grant.
 *
 * To start, please add the variables for configuring the client & the wallet addresses for the payment.
